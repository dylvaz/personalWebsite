    "about": "I am a skilled full-stack developer with experience in front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize in developing end-to-end applications that provide an optimal user experience.\n\n\n Across various positions, I've demonstrated proficiency in both full-stack and mobile development. At Akluvis, I led the development of a state-of-the-art GraphQL API, enhancing data exchange efficiency and application performance. My tenure at Ksense Technologies saw me spearheading initiatives to revolutionize web-based applications, resulting in a 20% increase in user engagement. Additionally, at Bazar Enterprises LLC, I facilitated the migration of a SwiftUI application to React Native, expanding the user base by 25%.\n\n\n Outside of work, I find joy in the simple pleasures of life, whether it's spending time with my loyal six-year-old dog or immersing myself in the excitement of Real Madrid games. These moments serve as reminders of the importance of balance and fulfillment beyond professional endeavors, enriching both my personal and professional life.",
